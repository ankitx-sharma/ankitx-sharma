## Hi there 👋
My name is Ankita Sharma, I am software developer and a tech enthusiast with over 8 years of IT experience with focus on Java.

## What I Do
Driven by curiosity and a love for structured, reliable systems, I focus on crafting robust backend solutions. My work spans RESTful API design, data-heavy applications, and integrating distributed systems using modern frameworks and best practices.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects across different industries — improving performance, optimizing database interactions, designing stable service layers, and supporting teams in delivering high-quality software. Alongside my development work, I regularly write technical blogs where I break down concepts into clear, practical explanations to help others learn with ease.

Learning is a constant part of my journey. I’m always exploring new tools, experimenting with technologies, and refining my engineering approach to stay adaptable in an ever-evolving tech landscape.
